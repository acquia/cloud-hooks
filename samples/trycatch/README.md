# Try-Catch

This cloudhook provides an example of how to simulate a try-catch block in bash.  This will allow you to send notifications for cloudhook failures only if you so wish.  

That way you protect against notification fatigue!

### Example Scenario

1. A failure occurs in a cloudhook
2. An action is taken in response.  What action?  You decide!
