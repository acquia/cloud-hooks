Sample cloud hook to rollback code deploy on testing failure

This hook utilizes the simpletest module to test code base during deployment and automatically 
rollback to the last deployed set of code on test failure. Since pre-code-deploy hooks don't exist
yet we store original code source in the origsource variable in the rollback settings file stored in
the $HOME dir. This file also lists drush test-run tests to be run. 

Installation Steps (assumes ah cloud hooks, and ahapi.drush.inc installed on server 
and in Version Control Software):
1) Copy rollback.sh into your dev, stage, prod, or common hooks directory.
2) SCP or SFTP rollback_settings to your $HOME dir on your Acquia Host Server. 
3) Edit rollback_settings to your existing code base and test setting. Ensure execute bits are
   set on both files. (i.e. chmod a+x rollback_settings and chmod a+x rollback.sh)
